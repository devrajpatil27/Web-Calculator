# Web Calculator

The Web Calculator project is a simple calculator application built for the web. It provides a user-friendly interface for performing basic arithmetic calculations. The calculator allows users to input numbers and perform operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the calculator interface and handle user interactions. It demonstrates the use of event handling, data manipulation, and dynamic content updating.

## Features

The Web Calculator project includes the following features:

1. User Interface: The calculator interface consists of number buttons (0-9), operation buttons (+, -, *, /), and a display area to show the entered numbers and results.

2. Number Input: Users can input numbers by clicking on the number buttons or by using the keyboard.

3. Operation Selection: Users can select an operation by clicking on the respective operation buttons.

4. Calculation: The calculator performs arithmetic calculations based on the selected operation and displays the result in the display area.

5. Clear Function: Users can clear the entered numbers and reset the calculator to its initial state.

6. Error Handling: The calculator handles errors such as division by zero and displays appropriate error messages to the user.

## Project Structure

The project can be organized into the following files:

1. `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the web calculator. It includes the necessary HTML elements for the calculator interface and display.

2. `styles.css`: The CSS file that provides the styling for the calculator. It defines the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects.

3. `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the calculator's functionality. It includes event listeners for button clicks, handles user input and operations, performs calculations, and updates the display.

## Getting Started

To run the Web Calculator project, follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory for your project.

2. Inside the project directory, create the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files mentioned above.

3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the calculator.

## Usage

1. Open the webpage in a web browser.

2. Use the number buttons to input the desired numbers.

3. Click on the operation buttons to select the desired arithmetic operation.

4. The calculator will display the entered numbers and the result in the display area.

5. To perform a calculation, click on the "=" button or press the "Enter" key.

6. To clear the entered numbers and reset the calculator, click on the "Clear" button.

7. If there are any errors in the calculations, such as division by zero, the calculator will display an appropriate error message.

8. Continue using the calculator to perform additional calculations as needed.

## Conclusion

The Web Calculator project provides a simple and user-friendly calculator application for basic arithmetic calculations. It demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive web interface. You can further enhance the project by adding advanced operations, support for decimal numbers, or additional functionality such as memory functions or scientific calculations.
